<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My Name is Martha Ramirez, I'm a returning student to cerritos college. I've been in customer service for over ten years. Although I really enjoyed my pervious carreer, I really needed a change. The tech industry seems to be growing and I wanted to learn more about it. I'm a big fan of puzzles and coding sure looks like fun one.</p>
    
<h3>When I have free time</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>I volunteer at my church</li>
        <li>Enjoy spending time with my family</li>
        <li>Going to the beach</li>
    </ol>
    <p>My favorite web site is <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> because I can get a lot of ideas for projects.</p>
